                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">April, 2025</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The Global Game Jam Hong Kong 2025 was officially ended. I heard about Global Game Jam Next for the first time from the Global Game Jam site when I tried to search "Hong Kong", then the "Next" game jam appeared on the search engine. This one is a five-day game jam for university level, so it gives more flexibility and less stressful than the 40-hour game jam.<br><br>At first, I had no intention of joining since I always wanted to make games as a team to make the experience meaningful and get a better quality. Also, the date was a tough day due to my university assignments were just too much to complete in that time, including the Unreal Engine project that I have been doing for the past few months. Him asked me to come join the game jam, but I said no because of that, and I was also afraid to not being able to contribute that much to the team as my workload is already too heavy.<br><br>I also joined the game jam's Discord server just for fun and to see how it goes, possibly for making some connections too. The chat wasn't very active as the Global Game Jam server.<br><br><strong>Day 1, Monday<br></strong><br>It's the D-Day for the game jam to start and it started off with the opening ceremony which takes place on HKIIT or IVE. I watched the livestream on YouTube as I have some spare time on campus. I was kinda confused with the given theme which was actually the same with the Global Game Jam, and that is "Bubble".<br><br>"Why do they have the same theme?" I ponder...<br><br>And the rules said that I can just submit the Global Game Jam submission if the game hasn't won any awards yet, which makes it legal. I didn't do it because it felt unfair and also knowing Him is doing the game jam with different game. So I pass.<br><br><strong>Day 2, Tuesday<br></strong><br>The group chat becomes really active for the first time. People started talking and asking for any collaborations for the game jam. Some people were struggling to find teammate that can do arts.<br><br>I asked about how many people are there in the game jam and it's almost the same as the global game jam, plus it has more people if combined with the high schoolers if total.<br><br><strong>Day 3, Wednesday<br></strong><br>My schedule wasn't too bad so I started to think of joining the game jam.<br><br>I suddenly had an idea of trying to use some mechanism like the ones on Global Game Jam. Computer Vision, multiplayer, voice control, etc.<br><br>Then I thought about tilting or rotating the phone as the main control.<br><br>Don't pop the bubble!<br><br>The idea came up after joining Global Game Jam where we made a game about bubble sort which requires players to pop the bubbles to reveal the randomized numbers. I thought about the opposite of not popping the bubbles as contrast.<br><br>Then I decided to join the game jam late.<br><br>Started quick prototype first with Unity and managed to make the input system working.<br><br><strong>Day 4, Thursday<br></strong><br>Started to put more obstacles like spikes and bombs, also some blocking components. Also added borders to prevent going out of screen.<br><br><strong>Day 5, Friday<br></strong><br>Added more fun, trying to adjust the increasing difficulty as time goes. Added score system. Then make a video and sleep.<br><br><strong>Day 6, Saturday, Presentation and Award Ceremony<br></strong><br>Surprised to see the rewards are the same as Global Game Jam. There are PS5, Switch, Board games, etc.<br><br>Presentation and awards split to two groups: high school and university.<br><br>Presentation process is just showing 1-minute video and you can either stay silent or talk a bit about your game.<br><br>Saw the high school projects and seems that they are more fully committed into making cool games.<br><br>After that, announcements. I managed to won the Best Overall award.<br><br>Very unexpected win for me.<br><br><strong>My thoughts about the Global Game Jam Next</strong><br><br>&nbsp;Difficulty is much easier compared to Global Game Jam.<br><br><strong>Key Points that I have learned from&nbsp;Global Game Jam Next<br></strong><br>Make it fun and well-polished</p>

                    <strong>Side Quest: Keep Flying High</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">September-November, 2024</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">What differs from the 2023 hackathon was that the location for the pitch is not just Hong Kong but also Shenzhen, while the development day was fully remote. Kendrew asked me to join the group so I join too as well for one more time.
<br>
<br><strong>Initial Submission Stage</strong><br><strong>
<br></strong>My thought was that this year's problem statements would benefit teams from Mainland China.
<br>
<br>We tried to come up with different ideas but we couldn't come up with any feasible ideas so we had to proceed with the idea we had for the registration.
<br>
<br>Most of us had busy schedules.
<br>
<br><strong>Pre-Development Day</strong><br>
<br>aaa<br><br><strong>Development Day Hour 1-6
</strong><br><br>The first time we read the problem statement, we thought that our idea we had from the initial submission can be used for this development stage.
<br>
<br>We tried to ask for some feedback to our coach, and our coach told us to go ask the experts, and gave her personal opinions on our ideas. When we asked our experts, they told us that our idea is not feasible. Their feedback contradicts with what our coach told us about.
<br>
<br>Desperation.
<br>
<br>So we spent some hours trying to come up with the better idea, then reached out to the experts with some other ideas, and they gave us more directions and insights on our idea until we found ourselves a solid idea so we could start the development. We also tried to confirm the idea with our coach but we didn't get any new information or direction from her. Since we already spent too much time on brainstorming, our team agreed to start the development.
<br>
<br><strong>Development Day Hour 7-12</strong><br><strong>
<br></strong>We started doing the development.
<br>
<br><strong>Development Day Hour 13-18</strong><br><strong>
</strong><br>I do the PowerPoint and the AR indoor navigation system.
<br>
<br><strong>Development Day Hour 19-22</strong><br><strong>
</strong><br>Everyone starts doing again.
<br>
<br><strong>Development Day Hour 23-24</strong><br><strong>
</strong><br>Pitch clinic with our last year coach Enoch. He told us that our idea is not the best solution and asked us to prepare more for the Q&amp;A session during the pitch.
<br>
<br><strong>First Pitch</strong><br><strong>
</strong><br>We went to the Cathay City for the offline first pitch.
<br>
<br>Since there are quite a lot of teams also on Cathay City, some teams did their pitch earlier while the rest had some minigames and tours on the Cathay City while waiting. We couldn't have the chance to practice our pitch while waiting for our pitch time.
<br>
<br>...
<br>
<br>At the end of the day, all teams gathered in a big room for the closing ceremony, there were approximately 50-60 teams in total if I count it correctly.
<br>
<br>All of us went back home and still ponders the chance for our team to make through the final stage since there are quite a lot of teams on Hong Kong and we didn't know the number of teams in Shenzhen itself.
<br>
<br><strong>Final Pitch</strong><br><strong>
</strong><br>I managed to check that ten teams made it through the final stage.
<br>
<br>However, we have one problem our main pitcher Tvesha can't enter Shenzhen because of visa issues. So, for the final pitch, we had to prepare for the worst scenario by having Kendrew as the main pitcher and me as the second pitcher doing the application demonstration. It was a big pressure, and Kendrew had the most pressure on preparing for the perfect pitch.
<br>
<br>We went to Shenzhen for the final pitch, which was also my first time to go to Shenzhen so I was really excited. As expected, Tvesha couldn't enter Shenzhen, so only four of us went to Shenzhen.
<br>
<br>I realized that our coach had two teams to handle on the final pitch, sadly our coach didn't care much about our team and only focused on the other team so we were alone.
<br>
<br>We somehow became the first group to present, that was rare for me to go first.
<br>
<br><strong>Award Ceremony</strong><br><strong>
</strong><br>Unfortunately, we didn't win any awards.
<br>
<br>A significant difference I felt was that after winning last year, there were quite a lot of Cathay people approached us and had a chat on our ideas. While for this year, we couldn't have a chat with a lot of Cathay people since they were interested on the winning ideas only. But there was one Cathay person who approached us and told that our team was his personal favorite, we were grateful to hear that.
<br>
<br>It was tough. The theme that we chose were also quite hard since the problem statement was quite straightforward. At least we made it to the top 10 finals. I also quite happy to saw my Indonesian friends (who are on different teams) won several awards.<br><br><strong>My thoughts about the Cathay Hackathon</strong><br><strong>
</strong><br>My personal thought that the 2023 hackathon was better compared 2024 hackathon since the 2023 hackathon was more collaborative with coaches and other teams which was really useful for the development and the environment seems to be more fun and supportive as well.
<br>
<br>I don't have much thoughts on the systems of the hackathon. The foods they provided were nice. The prize is also good.
<br>
<br>The only criticism I have would be the balance of fairness on the support from the coaches. There are significant support gap between our 2023 coach which was really infomative and well-distributed in handling all teams compared to our 2024 coach which was lack of information and only focuses on one team by abandoning the other teams.
<br>
<br>But overall, it was a really good experience for everyone who wants to have a better portfolio and also develop teamwork abilities and responsibilities as like working in companies. It's also a good time to connect with different people and experts, especially if you want to work in Cathay Pacific then it's worth joining.
<br>
<br><strong>Key Points that I have learned from Cathay Hackathon</strong><br><strong>
</strong><br>Presentation is highly important. You are trying to do a business presentation on the product you have, not showing what you did during the development period.
<br>
<br>To make a good team, you team chemistry is highly important to make working synergy more effective as team communication is important to put everyone into the same idea. It's not easy if you want to win the hackathon while you aren't familiar with your teammates yet. So, it's better to go to this hackathon with your friends.
<br>
<br>You also need to know what they can do the best for the hackathon. For our case, we had one mainly as the pitcher, one focused on building pitch PowerPoint, one working on the front end, and two working on the back end.
<br>
<br>FYI, if you want to get featured in Cathay's post articles or videos about the hackathon, make sure not to cover your green Cathay hackathon shirts :)
<br>
<br><strong>Why did I join the Cathay Hackathon twice?</strong><br><strong>
</strong><br>I joined the Cathay Hackathon for the second time to experience it again. The best part is working in a team. It's really fun to work in a team with passionate members. It's the best feeling for me, as it feels like a dream.
<br>
<br>Friendship and teamwork make dream work.

                    I have made a lot of games.<br><br>However, there is one thing that I'm missing in my portfolio.<br><br>Working for others.<br><br>It's a really critical thing to have in portfolio which can better prepare you for working in a company in adults life. Starting from intern, full-time, etc.<br><br>From the past few years, I did help others projects.<br><br>But I felt like it's not quite enough experience to earn due to several reasons.<br><br>1. It's just a duo/trio devs project.<br>For me, working on a really small team doesn't really give much experience on having to commit my desire on working on a game.<br><br>2. Lone programmer starting from scratch.<br>If you work alone as a programmer of the game which no one can give feedbacks on how I code.<br><br>3. No enough passion.<br>Mostly just for fun.<br><br>4. No trust build. In fact, I was scammed twice.<br>No funding and clear payment is hard.<br><br><strong>Getting Started<br></strong><br>How I try to find is through Roblox's Talent Hub, Discord community servers, and Developer Hub game in Roblox.<br><br>Lufo contacted me from Developer Hub. But I was AFK that time, at least I put a sign of my Discord username in case I went AFK, so he contacted me through Discord.<br><br>Asked me to do AI pathfinding. I agreed.<br><br>Asked me to do other ad-hoc tasks. Made me lead developer.<br><br><strong>Development Time</strong><br><br>Group has around 6-10 people.<br><br>Has another programmer, Yoricle. But he wasn't that active on the group.<br><br>Did AI pathfinding, more complex than I thought.<br><br>Did some other stuffs: puzzles, matchmaking, etc.<br><br>Then Yoricle got active, then completed some other programming tasks that I haven't finished it yet.<br><br>Payed attention on how he scripted, clearly different style from me. Usually I create multiple script objects since it's faster and easier for me to code. Drawback is the potential spagethi code which is hard to maintain. While him uses modulescripts where you can put many functions that sometimes gets triggered for the same thing, similar like Unity or Unreal Engine scripting method.<br><br><strong>Slow Down</strong><br><br>No more task. Lufo demoted me to contributor role since there's no more job, and Yoricle became the lead project.<br><br>Didn't follow up that often on the progress.<br><br>Some members leave or demoted to contributor role.<br><br>No clear directions on the game. No clear release date.<br><br>I don't know what happened on the team.<br><br>My assumption is:<br><br>1. Not reached satisfaction point.<br><br>2. No real development experience.<br><br>3. No motivation. Payments are still unclear.<br><br><strong>Key Points that I have learned from Kaiko</strong><br><br>Made me realize the importance of writing clean code through object-oriented programming style.<br><br>Made me also realize that what I've been doing is just handling too many projects which leads to misfocus on the task I need to do. Made me self committed to just focus on 1-2 projects at a time.&nbsp;<br></p>

Eventually most of them became inactive on 2024.<br><br>I tried envision really early on the plan of the game, ambitious to make a perfect game while hoping to release it after completion. Originally was a shooting game.<br><br>I worked early on the third person shooting mechanics to learn the engine itself.<br><br>Quite annoying to debate after the Unity controversy. I was certain that the controversy was temporary and won't affect a bit on our game since we won't be able to reach 100k that fast. My friends just keeps hating on Unity and proposing to use random game engines that barely people knows or uses.<br><br><strong>January<br></strong><br>From Discord server, Moose and Zaria joined. Later Gahyun voluntarily joined our group, so it's a total of six people.<br><br>Did some brainstorming meeting at the end of January. We chose to skip the 2-hour lecture to do 2-hour brainstorming meeting to save our time. Result is some combination of Stray cat, Enter the Gungeon dungeon style, and Muck survival game.<br><br>Decided to use Unity at the end since it's the easiest engine to use for everyone.<br><br><strong>February</strong><br><br>Another brainstorming meeting to see whether anyone has new ideas or not. We stick to those ideas and come up with spider as the main character to do the procedural animation which would be really good to have on our 3D game.<br><br>I started working on the procedural animation and Cog started working on 3D modeling the spider character and VFX effects.<br><br>Also did the project plan presentation powerpoint which we had to present on the day. Had to share screen our powerpoint through Zoom since there was no cable to connect to the class projector and oo bad our animation powerpoint was a bit laggy.<br><br>We also need to submit project proposal as part of the assessment.<br><br><strong>March</strong><br><br>I developed the spider control and attack system, and enemies' simple AI pathfinding with Nav Mesh. Still had some minor issues on positioning the spider leg kinematics. Did some basic active skills. Cog completed some VFX and started producing some musics, and some more 3D modeling completed with textures. Dorj started looking for inspirations for the final boss fight. Zaria started working on the level design and storyline.<br><br>Also had to submit the progress report.<br><br><strong>April</strong><br><br>Started working hard to meet the deadline.<br><br>...<br><br>Did presentation and went well.<br><br><strong>Post Development Period<br></strong><br>Showcased on HKU's 9th Inno Show. I remembered being able to collect 20-25 "Good Job" votes.<br><br>Also Cyberport Community Connect x GameDEVA Christmas Party.<br><br>Also submitted to DevGAMM just to get some feedback and some experience on learning how does awarding works. A feedback is "lack of soul".<br><br><strong>Future Plans<br></strong><br>Unfortunately there are no future plan on continuing the development of this game as 4 out of 6 teammates chose to left the game as it's just for course project and focus on their own goals.<br></p>

                    <strong>Side Quest: Dreamers Never Die</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">September-November, 2023</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The first time I heard about the hackathon was from my friend Richie. He asked me to join the hackathon as a team alongside his friend Jam. Later, we invited our friend Dorj to hop on the team. Several days later, my summer intern friend Kendrew was looking for a team so I asked him too.
<br>
<br>At first, our lineup was solid. By the time we joined the hackathon, Jam was a senior with prior knowledge from his other previous hackathon. Richie had a summer internship experience in a startup company working on a Flutter app. Dorj had extensive experience in Flutter and was strong in competitive programming. Kendrew did some personal front-end projects and had experience in creating UI/UX on Figma. I have a strong background in game development and have done many projects so I know how to create well-polished projects. I also have video-making experience using Adobe Premiere Pro, and Canva for creating pitch PowerPoint.
<br>
<br>During the registration stage, we met to fill out the registration form together and try to come up with a decent idea since the form requires us to do so. Although it’s just for registration, we spent quite a while on the idea because we didn’t know much about the criteria to go through the next stage.
<br>
<br><strong>Initial Submission Stage</strong><br><strong>
<br></strong>After making it through the registration stage, Cathay gave us several problem statements that we could choose (Premium Lifestyle, Travel Experience, and Cargo) and also access to the Microsoft Teams account to connect with Cathay people. That is where I also found out our opponents and found out that there are a total of around 550 participants making it through the initial submission stage, meaning that there should be around 110 – 183 teams in total, which is quite a lot.
<br>
<br>I tried to analyze how Cathay Hackathon works by searching the past years. When I checked the Cathay Pacific news about the year-2022 hackathon, I found out that there were only 20 teams invited for the development day. So I assumed that it would be the same for that year (which I was wrong later), I predicted the chance for us to go through the initial submission stage was only around 10-18%, so we had to do well.
<br>
<br>With that low probability, we tried to spend several days to come up with several ideas until we found a really good idea. However, we couldn’t come up with an idea that could be agreed by all five of us until two days before the initial submission deadline. We had a group meeting and decided to proceed with the best idea we had and then proceed to make the poster and the presentation video.
<br>
<br><strong>Pre-Development Day</strong><br><strong>
<br></strong>Several days later, we got the result that we were qualified for the next stage. We later had the opportunity to chat with our coach Enoch Wang, a solution specialist in Cathay Pacific. We asked about what to expect on the development day.
<br>
<br>On development day, I found quite a lot of my friends also doing the hackathon, so my thoughts were really impressive. Later, our coach told us that there are 60 teams in total, 20 teams in each category, I was like “Oh…” kinda surprised me since the total number of teams is three times more than the total in 2022.
<br>
<br><strong>Development Day Hour 1-2</strong><br><strong>
<br></strong>For the first hour (10 AM), our coach brought us to our room and explained what to do during the Hackathon. He also told us that only six teams will go through the final stage, so it means the chance for us would be 10%.
<br>
<br>Then we had lunch. We had lunch with our coach and talked about some of our ideas. However, our coach gave the feedback that most of the ideas we have are not feasible and not unique enough. He told us to think about something that Cathay hadn’t done.
<br>
<br>I mentioned an app to help blind people navigate in the airport, an idea that I had thought about a day before the development day. Our coach said that the idea was okay. Our team then tried to expand the idea into an app to help disabled people travel with ease, which not only helps blind people. He mentioned that Cathay hadn’t done that kind of idea, so our team managed to agree on one idea for the first time.
<br>
<br><strong>Development Day Hour 3-6</strong><br><strong>
<br></strong>We spent most of the time researching about our idea.
<br>
<br>We also went to meet the experts who are available for Q&amp;As during the first six hours of the development day. We asked for some opinions about our current ideas to some experts. One of the experts mentioned that Cathay hadn’t done that idea before.
<br>
<br>At the same time, there are some optional fun sessions for teams to come and attend but we didn't attend them so we have more time to work on our solution.
<br>
<br>After doing more research, we reached back to our coach to get more opinions.
<br>
<br><strong>Development Day Hour 7-14</strong><br><strong>
<br></strong>After getting enough feedback and research, we started the development by creating a working app prototype using Flutter. Dorj, Richie, and Jam immediately set up the core programs. Kendrew started creating UI mockups for developer reference and for the PowerPoint pitch. I started to create the PowerPoint pitch using Canva. When I had nothing to put on the PowerPoint, I joined the development team and worked on the chatbot system integrated with OpenAI LLM.
<br>
<br><strong>Development Day Hour 15-18</strong><br><strong>
</strong><br>After hours of development, we felt something off with our idea because it didn’t seem to be innovative enough. To solve that issue, we made some changes to our original idea by implementing new features.
<br>
<br>Dorj gave me some input on the PowerPoint which allows me to have clear direction. Most of my teammates fell asleep to gain more energy to complete the prototype and prepare for the pitch. I didn't sleep because I needed to finish the PowerPoint perfectly.
<br>
<br><strong>Development Day Hour 19-24</strong><br><strong>
<br></strong>All of our members were awake and started wrapping up the prototype. Turns out, there were some difficulties in solving one particular problem which was quite critical for the innovation point. One of us focused on solving it while the rest worked on polishing and checking the PowerPoint, including filling out the one-pager.
<br>
<br><strong>First Pitch</strong><br><strong>
</strong><br>After the 24-hour development day was concluded (10 AM). We first had breakfast. Then, we went back to our room to prepare for our pitch. We only had about 3 hours to prepare.
<br>
<br>Originally, the pitching lineup consisted of Jam as the main pitcher, Richie as the second pitcher, and me as the controller of the PowerPoint. Due to some of our lack of sleep and energy, we had a small line-up change into Jam as the main pitcher explaining the problem statement and the solution, Dorj as the second pitcher explaining the tech stacks, and Richie controlling the PowerPoint. We had some practices several times with our coach leaving some feedback for our perfect pitch, including some small adjustments on the PowerPoint to ensure the pitcher was able to keep the pitch flow well.
<br>
<br>Right before our turn, we were waiting at the front of the door of the pitching room. A Cathay person (probably the coach of the other team) approached us and looked at our pitch slides. I showed him our slides as I was holding the laptop for the pitch, and he said "There's a team that has a similar idea as yours, but you have nice PowerPoint." At first, we quite panicked but still keep ourselves calm and do our best.<br><br>We even had a small shout of "3.. 2.. 1.. Skydreamers!" to motivated ourselves a bit.
<br>
<br>When we walked inside the pitching room, there were about 10 judges. About 7 of them were around middle ages and the other 3 seemed quite young. There were also a moderator that controlled the time for us to pitch for 5 minutes and the other 5 minutes to do a Q&amp;A session. Our pitch went smoothly and ended before overtime. The Q&amp;A lasted long for 5 minutes as the judges kept asking questions about either the technical or the extensibility of our app.
<br>
<br>After we finished our first pitch, we became less energetic, tired, and hopeless, pondering whether our work was good enough to make it into the top six teams. We packed up our belongings until the result announcements announced our group number and we were shocked to hear that in disbelief. We made it through the final stage.
<br><br><strong>Final Pitch</strong><br>
<br>We were given about 1-2 hour to prepare for the final pitch. We tried to fix some codes on the prototype in case of needed to demonstrate the prototype. We kept the same plan as how we did on the first pitch but focuses more on the business side instead of the technical side as there will be more judges watching our presentation and most of them weren't that specific into the technical stuff that we were doing.
<br>
<br><strong>Award Ceremony</strong><br>
<br>We were quite satisfied with our hard work. We were surprised to win the Best Developer Award and Best Innovation Award too as well. The most important thing is that we won 2nd Runner-up. It was my first time doing a hackathon and somehow ended up beating the other 1500 participants by winning the second Runner-up and those other awards. The hackathon changed my perspective on being pessimistic on doing competitions to wanting to work hard again.
<br>
<br><strong>Post Cathay Hackathon 2023</strong><br>
<br>After the hackathon ended, we were invited by Cathay to the conference to showcase our ideas, as well as a special collaboration between Cathay x Skydreamers to make our idea into real life solution. I'm sure this also works for the winner and the first runner-up. We also have ourselves being featured on HKU's Instagram since we were the only group with only HKU students to win second Runner-up on Cathay Hackathon.</p>

                    <strong>The Revolutionary of AI</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">2022-2023</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">AI's popularity blew up after ChatGPT 3 was released on November 2022. Everyone starts talking about how powerful the AI chatbot is which becomes a global phenomena as a&nbsp; breakthrough of learning. The Talking NPC blew up too at that time since it's related to AI chatbots. Interestingly, the game was made before the release of that GPT model.<br><br><strong>Pre Development (Summer 2022)</strong><br><br>There were two factors that motivated me to make this game.<br><br>First factor, that time I was developing Infinite Obby. Then, I got bored a bit and wanted to make something new to relieve my boredom in making games. A quick game project that I can release it in less than a week.<br><br>Second factor, it was almost the time after my high school graduation, meaning its before I started university. I want to go to Computer Science.<br><br>For getting the Computer Science major on the 2nd year, I noticed that there's a quota.<br><br>I did panicked a bit on my skills that may be not enough as Hong Kong University is also known for its competitiveness and there must be a lot of smart people. But still chose HKU since it would be good to improve my programming skills so I can make better games quick. So I wanted to study early before going to university. Studied some year one courses. Saw some courses related to AI.<br><br>I tried learning different programming languages beside lua, like Python and a little bit of C++. To further develop my skills, I thought of trying to create a chatbot as a coding project since having project is useful to develop our skills fast.<br><br>That time I have no knowledge on how to make AI, or even what is LLM. What I did first is just followed the Python programming tutorial on YouTube. Uses the Key Matching algorithm.<br><br>Then, somehow had an idea to do it on Roblox since Roblox games on have NPC packed with dialogue system where players just choose 1-3 dialogue options to chat. So it's just scripted chatbot, while the Python tutorial doesn't do that way. So I wanted to try doing it so I can improve my programming skills even better.<br><br><strong>First Development (Summer 2022)</strong><br><br>Just copy paste the code. Then need to debug since Roblox uses Lua. Of course, my programming skill was pretty bad that time but still a good start for me to learn by debugging some built-in functions.<br><br>It took about 1-2 days to complete the Lua to Python migration and ensure all the functionalities works well due to syntaxes and objects set by Roblox Studio.<br><br><strong>Continue (Early 2023)</strong><br><br>Added some secret endings like when you made him mad or even killed him by accident.<br><br>Also guest 666 easter egg.<br><br>Reuvinn added the FBI idea referencing from the "FBI, OPEN UP" meme.<br><br><strong>Sudden Recognition and Game Updates</strong><br><br>Flamingo made his regular video and this time the video was about chatbots which featured The Talking NPC game. The game suddenly get above 300 concurrent players, almost the same amount as Obby Master's peak concurrent players.<br><br>Discord server becomes so active, questioning on how to obtain certain game endings.<br><br>Few days later, more YouTubers started the same. KraoESP, Sebee, etc.<br><br>I put them into secret egg characters in the game too.<br><br>later, player drops a bit.<br><br>But somehow the game got into Roblox's recommendation list, attracting even more players.<br><br>Reached 1.350 players peak and also surpasses 1 million total visits. Even added a secret ending for celebrating the milestone.<br><br>Keep making more contents.<br><br>More YouTubers like Sketch.<br><br><strong>Post Peak</strong><br><br>Life gets busy as time goes, need to focus on university.<br><br>Not much updates were made.<br><br>Did 2 small quick games "The Goofy NPC" and "2 NPCS Talking To Each Others". Game is to test the implementation of LLM for the NPCs.<br><br>Small updates and events were made to maintain the players activeness. However, its quite hard to maintain popularity in this game since there are new gameplay mechanics that can be added.<br><br><strong>My Thoughts and Key Lessons</strong><br><br>Had a really hard time just to work hard on getting more players.<br><br>As a consequence, I focused more on how to get players without thinking effectively on how to make a fresh and new game concept like The Talking NPC, a game where you can that with a NPC freely like ChatGPT.<br><br>Following a trend surely does help, while creating a new trend is hard and risky, but has a chance for being viral and easily recognized by more players.<br><br>Sticking on the same game for years is just waste of time if the game doesn't do well. Start a new better game is what's the best that we could do to not waste potential.<br><br><strong>Future Plans</strong><br><br>Creating "NPC World", also known as "The Talking NPC 2".<br><br></p>

So I had to accept.<br><br>Also created a new group "Obby Master Universe", a group to hold Obby Master fanbase.<br><br>I granted him full authority to manage Obby Master 2.<br><br>On mid-production, filled with too-high ambitions, he saw our team is doing less work than expected, raged himself and then left the project. So there are no project lead and I had to step up to take the lead.<br><br>Worked fine.<br><br><strong>Last Remarks</strong><br><br>The best part is to interact with the community.<br><br>I miss those moments.</p>
